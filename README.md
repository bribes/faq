FAQ / About
Q: Who made this?
A: [The 88 GitHub organization](https://github.com/88) and [Faav](https://github.com/withdrew).

Q: Can you remove my name history / personal information / etc?
A: Our website fetches results from Mojang's own public APIs as well as third-party APIs that utilize Mojang's API. In order to remove personal information, please contact Mojang by doing so [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Q: What is PHD / MSA / etc?
A: PHD means "pseudo-hard-deleted", a term used to describe accounts that show up in some parts of Mojang's API but not others. The usernames of PHD accounts can't be claimed but they also don't appear tied to an account. MSA means "Microsoft Account", which is pretty self explanatory. [add more definitions here]

Q: Why do some users have emojis?
A: Emojis are given out for free to users who have contributed to the website, or friends of the owners. They are not publicly obtainable at this time.

Q: What information do you store?
A: Nothing. We don't cache users, although we plan to do this in the future. Users can opt-out of caching per search once this feature is added.
